# -------------------------------
# Python Practice Problem Set â€“ Part 3 (Part 2)
# Topics: Bitwise, Identity, Membership Operators
# Instructions: Complete each function as described.
# -------------------------------

# Q1. Bitwise Operators
# Input: Two integers a and b
# Task: Return a dictionary with results of:
# a & b, a | b, a ^ b, ~a, a << 2, b >> 1
def bitwise_operations(a, b):
    # Write your code here
    pass


# Q2. Identity Operators
# Input: Two variables x and y
# Task: Return a dictionary with:
# - x is y
# - x is not y
def identity_operations(x, y):
    # Write your code here
    pass


# Q3. Membership Operators
# Input: An element and a container (list or string)
# Task: Return a dictionary with:
# - element in container
# - element not in container
def membership_operations(element, container):
    # Write your code here
    pass


# Bonus Challenge
# Input: A number
# Task: Return True if the number is a power of 2 using bitwise operators only
def is_power_of_two(n):
    # Write your code here
    pass

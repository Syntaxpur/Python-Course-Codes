# -------------------------------
# Python Practice Problem Set â€“ Part 3 (Part 1)
# Topics: Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment Operators
# Instructions: Complete each function as described.
# -------------------------------

# Q1. Arithmetic Operators
# Input: Two numbers a and b
# Task: Print sum, difference, product, quotient, modulus, exponent, and floor division
def arithmetic_operations(a, b):
    # Write your code here
    pass


# Q2. Comparison Operators
# Given: x and y
# Task: Print the result of x == y, x != y, x > y, x <= y
def comparison_operators(x, y):
    # Write your code here
    pass


# Q3. Logical Operators
# Given: a, b, c
# Task: Print:
# - a > b and c > a
# - a < b or c > a
# - not (a > c)
def logical_operators(a, b, c):
    # Write your code here
    pass


# Q4. Assignment Operators
# Given: num = 10
# Task: Apply operations and print after each:
# +=5, -=3, *=2, /=4, //=2, %=3, **=2
def assignment_operators(num):
    # Write your code here
    pass


# Bonus Challenge
# Write a calculator that performs +, -, *, /
# Ask user to input two numbers and the operation
def calculator():
    # Write your code here
    pass

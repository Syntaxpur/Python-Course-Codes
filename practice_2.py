# Python Practice Problem Set â€“ Part 3 (Part 1)
# Topics: Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment Operators
# -------------------------------

#  Q1. Arithmetic Operators
# Input two numbers and display:
# - Sum
# - Difference
# - Product
# - Quotient
# - Modulus
# - Exponent
# - Floor Division

# Write your code here 


#  Q2. Comparison Operators
# Given:
x = 20
y = 15
# Check and print:
# - x == y
# - x != y
# - x > y
# - x <= y

# Write your code here 


#  Q3. Logical Operators
a = 10
b = 5
c = 15
# Check and print:
# - a > b and c > a
# - a < b or c > a
# - not (a > c)

# Write your code here 


#  Q4. Assignment Operators
num = 10
# Apply the following and print the result after each:
# - += 5
# - -= 3
# - *= 2
# - /= 4
# - //= 2
# - %= 3
# - **= 2

# Write your code here 


#  Bonus Challenge
# Write a calculator that performs +, -, *, /
# Ask user to choose operation and input two numbers

# Write your code here
